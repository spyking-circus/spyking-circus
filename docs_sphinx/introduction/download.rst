How to get the code
===================

The code is currently hosted on BitBucket_, in a public repository, relying on Git_, at https://bitbucket.org/yger/spyking-circus. The following explanations are only for 
those that want to get a copy of the git folder, with a cutting-edge version of the software.

.. note::

    The code can be installed automatically to its latest release using ``pip`` or ``conda`` (see :doc:`How to install <../introduction/install>`).


Cloning the source
------------------

Create a folder called ``spyking-circus``, and simply do::
